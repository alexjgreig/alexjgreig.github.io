I have a deep passion for quantum technology, AI and financial markets with experience in derivatives trading and market making at UBS. I am highly driven, ambitious and able to perform to high standards while remaining resilient under pressure. My interests in quantum technology led me to undertake a research project pertaining to the verification of quantum programs, leading to an undergraduate research scholarship from Sydney Quantum Academy. Additionally, I was selected to help manage the USYD Student Investment Fund which has a dual-mandate of providing students portfolio management experience, while simultaneously funding scholarships for disadvantaged students.

Some projects that I have created personally are below:

* https://github.com/alexjgreig/Quave

A quantum algorithm verification (Quave) tool that uses Lean 4. This tool implements a syntax, operational semantics and denotational semantics of quantum programs so that their correctness can be verified.

* https://github.com/alexjgreig/riverina

A systematic investment system and FIX Engine written in Rust that utilises realtime FX price data and regression models for order execution and backtesting. 

* https://github.com/alexjgreig/Nodepaths

A distributed communication application built upon a wireless ad-hoc network using mesh topology, made with the Rust programming language. 

* https://github.com/alexjgreig/converge

Converge is a decentralised blockchain for sophisticated asset management and cross-business transactions.
